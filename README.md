# TOP-Library

The first project of the Javascript section of The Odin Project. Create a page allowing the user to add books to a virtual library.
The user should be able to specify the title, author, number of pages, and whether or not they've read the book. 
The user should also be able to edit the library by removing books or changing the read status of the books.
